JavaScript Description:
Have you ever stood in a Ben&Jerry's ice-cream shop and wonder which flavor to order?
Are you worried that you accidentally order a flavor that you don't like?
This website is developed for users to figure out what ingredients are inside of each flavor.
What's more, it helps users to know flavors they might like by actively searching with ingredients that they like.
I used JavaScript to make the site interactive, such as searching for ice-cream flavors based on the ingredients buttons they clicked.
And then, i used JavaScript to redirect them to a chart consisting the make-ups of the certain ice-cream flavors.
Hope you enjoy this website and hopefully use it to determin which scoope to have next time you are inside a Ben&Jerry store!

Bootstrap Description:
I used Bootstrap link all the html pages using a Bootstrap navbar
